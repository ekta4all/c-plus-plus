Runtime Polymorphism

virtual function

virtual-->keyword

Virtual function is a function which is declared in the parent/base class and redefined by a child/derived class. When we refer a child class ojbect using a base pointer or reference to the base class we can call a virtual function and it is exceute the derived class.

Rules-->

1. virtual can't be static
2. It can be a friend function
3. Virtual function should be accessed using the pointer or reference of base class
4. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism
5. The prototype of virtual function should be same in the base class as well as in the derived class.
6. It is always defined in the base class and override in the derived class.


Pure Virtual function-->

A function is not used for performing any task.
It only serve as a placeholder.
It has no definition
It is also known as do-nothing function
It is declared in the base class that has no definition
